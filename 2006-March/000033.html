<PRE>Hi Miche`le,

Firstly i would like to thank you very much for your feedback!

&gt;<i> HI list.
</I>&gt;<i> One question and some feature request.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First of all I have noticed that the outputbox is really faster. 
</I>&gt;<i> And I think this is okkey :)
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe when LaTeX exit with status zero the asterisk would be blue
</I>&gt;<i> [everything&#236;s fine], instead when exit with status !0 would be red [some
</I>&gt;<i> problem here]
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>oops. i will fix this [ winefish -1.3.2.8 ]
&gt;<i> The question:
</I>&gt;<i> I didn't understood the functionality of the three columns. More over,
</I>&gt;<i> is it possible to hidden in some way ?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Do you mean the column of outputbox?

the first: line number
the second: the basename of the file
the third: the message

when some errors occur `latex' will be report like this:
 &gt;&gt; foobar.tex:12:undefined control sequence
then winefish will capture it like this:
 &gt;&gt; 12 foobar.tex undefined control sequence

if there is linenumber, single click will open the file at specific line
and control+click will create a clone file. See winefish.html for more 
details.
&gt;<i> The feautures :
</I>&gt;<i> - A color box would be really good. I mean, in the left tabs a box with
</I>&gt;<i> all the 68 colour named that comes with the graphics package.
</I>&gt;<i> The user should select one of them and with &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Alt&gt;&lt;O&gt; [the C is
</I>&gt;<i> used for the Cursive] could insert this colour in the document.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The box would contain a square and nearby the name of the Colour. Maybe
</I>&gt;<i> two colunms would be ok.
</I>&gt;<i> Let me explain in the ASCI art :)
</I>&gt;<i>  _            _
</I>&gt;<i> |_| Brown    |_| Yellow
</I>&gt;<i>  _            _
</I>&gt;<i> |_| Red      |_| Orange
</I>&gt;<i>  _            _
</I>&gt;<i> |_| Blu      |_| Apricot
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ...          ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - A tabs with Symbols. I know it is possible to download from CTAN the
</I>&gt;<i> Symbols.pdf, but If you could have really accessible the Symbol that you
</I>&gt;<i> need from your preferred LaTeX IDE it wouldn't be good ?
</I>People asks me for this features so many times ;) I currently cannot 
support this because:
* i am too busy with my maths studies;
* winefish currently doesnot support plugins;
* some other features should be implement first ( command editor, code 
folding);
* etc;

so symbols.pdf is the best way ;)

thank you again for your report.

best regards,

kyanh
