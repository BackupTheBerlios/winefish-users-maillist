Okkey. First of all I think winefish is really a cool editor for LaTeX,
and a lot of friends are going to use it ;)

I also presented it on my LUG. ;)

Now, why I'm so boring about the release number .. try to explain.

I'm on gentoo, and I can install winefish from source with emerge.

Scenario :
Two version of winefish avaible:
1.3.2.8a --&gt; installed
1.3.2 [stable the new one] --&gt; not installed (newer)
the command :
emerge --update winefish
should pick the new version and install it. So where is the trouble ?
The trouble is that in ASCII comparison 1.3.2.8a is &gt; respect 1.3.2, so
emerge thinks that I have the last avaible version installed, which is
*not* true ;)

Want try it ?

just

# mkdir check (in an empty folder would be more clear)
# cd check
# echo &quot;foo&quot; &gt; 1.3.2.8a
# echo &quot;foo&quot; &gt; 1.3.2

then try
#ls -l
and show which one come first
in my system I get

<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/winefish-users">mattions at the-tux</A> ~/Desktop/check $ ls -l
totale 8
-rw-r--r-- 1 mattions users 4 31 mar 14:52 1.3.2
-rw-r--r-- 1 mattions users 4 31 mar 14:52 1.3.2.8a

the 1.3.2 &lt; 1.3.2.8a and is shown first.

That's why when you release a new version of the winefish you should use
a bigger third number, respect the devel version. In this cause should
had been 1.3.3.

Hope this more clear.



&gt;<i> Note that I will start a new branch now
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> scheme 1:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1.3.2 (now)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1.4.0 (new branch &lt;== thing i wanna do now)
</I>&gt;<i>   1.4.0.1 (devel)
</I>&gt;<i>   1.4.0.2  (devel)
</I>&gt;<i>   ...
</I>&gt;<i>   1.4.0 (release)
</I>&gt;<i> 1.4.1 (minor bug fixed)
</I>&gt;<i> 1.4.1 (minor bug fixed
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> 1.5.0 ( new branch again)
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> is this okay?
</I>No...It's not ok ;)

Try to explain

One way would be:
scheme 1:

1.3.2 (now)

1.4.1.0 (new branch &lt;== note the odd number -- development -- we start
 with 1, not with 0, because is a new branches and a lot of new features
 are in testing)   

  1.4.1.1  (devel)   
  1.4.1.2  (devel)   
  ...   
when times are mature 1.4.1.last_devel_version ==&gt; 1.4.2.0

1.4.2.0 (release -- stable -- note the even number) 
  1.4.2.1 (minor bug fixed)
  1.4.2.2 (minor bug fixed
...

1.4.3.0 (devel)
  1.4.3.1 (devel)
...
when times are mature 1.4.3.last_deve_version ==&gt; 1.4.4.0

1.4.4.0 (release)
  1.4.4.1 (minor bug fixed)

New branch

1.5.1.0

Why do this ?
If you have installed the 1.4.1.0 but a new release is available  its
number would be 1.4.2.0, then 1.4.2.0 &gt; 1.4.1.0 =&gt; the right version
would be chosen.


scheme 2 (i think more clear):

1.3.2 [now]

1.4.0 (release the some code that is now named 1.3.2 as 1.4.0. In this
way we get a release version with an even number, and we have the
possibility to have minor bug fixes)
1.4.1 (minor bug fix)
1.4.2 (minor bug fix)
....


1.5.0 (devel) [first release for new branches, we would use only odd
number for development to be standard]
1.5.1 (devel)
1.5.2 (devel)
...
when testing is okkey and times are mature 1.5.last_development_version
==&gt; 1.6.0 

1.6.0 (stable) 
1.6.1 (minor bug fix)
1.6.2 (minor bug fix)
...

1.7.0 (new branches for development)
1.7.1 (devel)
1.7.2 (devel)
....
when times are mature 1.7.last_development_version ==&gt; 1.8.0

1.8.0 (stable)


If an user has the 1.5.x version installed and a new stable version
becomes available   (1.6.0) with an update command the right version
would be chosen.

Hope it's more clear. 

I think all the packages-managers [apt-get, yum, yast,
synaptics , .... ]   use the ASCII alphabet to compare which one is
greater, so which one is newer and has to be installed. 
Surely emerge think in this way. 

&gt;<i> &gt;   
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; P.s.: I've just write a news in footnotes about winefish...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've taken the changelog directly from winefish release note on web ;)
</I>&gt;<i> Great ;) ... but i almost couldnot find it . could you give me a link :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I write about it on <A HREF="http://gnomedesktop.org/">http://gnomedesktop.org/</A>
Today I'm not able to connect to their site.
Until yesterday they didn't authorized my news.. but I hope that in few
days it would be authorized and displayed on their home-page.
&gt;<i> You make winefish Live! Many many many thanks!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>I'm just an happy user... You are the master ;)

Michele
