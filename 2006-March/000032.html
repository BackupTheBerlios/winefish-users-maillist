<PRE>HI list.
One question and some feature request.

First of all I have noticed that the outputbox is really faster. 
And I think this is okkey :)
Maybe when LaTeX exit with status zero the asterisk would be blue
[everything&#236;s fine], instead when exit with status !0 would be red [some
problem here]

The question:
I didn't understood the functionality of the three columns. More over,
is it possible to hidden in some way ?

The feautures :
- A color box would be really good. I mean, in the left tabs a box with
all the 68 colour named that comes with the graphics package.
The user should select one of them and with &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Alt&gt;&lt;O&gt; [the C is
used for the Cursive] could insert this colour in the document.

The box would contain a square and nearby the name of the Colour. Maybe
two colunms would be ok.
Let me explain in the ASCI art :)
 _            _
|<i>_| Brown    |_| Yellow
</I> _            _
|<i>_| Red      |_| Orange
</I> _            _
|<i>_| Blu      |_| Apricot
</I>
...          ...

- A tabs with Symbols. I know it is possible to download from CTAN the
Symbols.pdf, but If you could have really accessible the Symbol that you
need from your preferred LaTeX IDE it wouldn't be good ?


Thanks for reading :)
