<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> Hi list.. I've seen there was a _stable-release_ ;)

</I>&gt;<i> Cool.

&gt;<i> Another idea about the way how the releases are named ...
</I>i am firstly  sorry about that i didn't use your suggestion in previous 
discussions. But... please wait... the true thing that: after something 
likes 1.3.2.7, 1.3.2.8,... i like to release the stable version 1.3.2 
(1.3.2 &gt; 1.3.2.x, really ?) (( We got the trouble because of some RC 
releases like 1.3.2-RC1,... ==&gt; this will not be repeated anymore ))

Does this make life harder ?
&gt;<i> Why don't use the same pattern of the gnome project ?
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> just
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1.4.x --&gt; stable version
</I>&gt;<i> 1.5.x --&gt; development
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I may use it. But i like your previous suggesstions! For the later one i 
really don't know how to make a new branch!!!

Below that i understood. Sorry for any mistake (==&gt; so more explain, plz ;))
Note that I will start a new branch now

scheme 1:

1.3.2 (now)

1.4.0 (new branch &lt;== thing i wanna do now)
  1.4.0.1 (devel)
  1.4.0.2  (devel)
  ...
  1.4.0 (release)
1.4.1 (minor bug fixed)
1.4.1 (minor bug fixed
...
1.5.0 ( new branch again)
...

is this okay?
&gt;<i> Anyway...
</I>&gt;<i> just don't release a package more updated [like the stable 1.3.2] with a
</I>&gt;<i> minor version compared to the development version [1.3.2.x], plz 
</I>&gt;<i> Every package manager would go crazy!!!!
</I>&gt;<i> ;)
</I>&gt;<i> IMHO.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>ooop i am sorry that I don't understand your idea here ;)

((
in comparing to wf 1.3.2.8.a (latest published devel release) the wf 
1.3.2 contains fixex for some bugs
))
&gt;<i> P.s.: I've just write a news in footnotes about winefish...
</I>&gt;<i> I've taken the changelog directly from winefish release note on web ;)
</I>Great ;) ... but i almost couldnot find it . could you give me a link :)

You make winefish Live! Many many many thanks!
