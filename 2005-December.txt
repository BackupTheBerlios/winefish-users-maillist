First of all I want to thank you to have wrote a gtk2 LaTeX editor
really cool :)

Well now. I'm on gentoo and there is an ebuild to get it installed on
the system.
The url is here :
http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=106164

I've installed and everything went fine.
So you can add this distro to the supported one.

One request :

It would be awesome if the quick start could include a user-defined
preamble.

Regards.
