CHANGES [ Winefish 1.3.2-5 ]

* BUGS fixed:
 - Major BUGS#{57,54,50}
 - Minor BUGS#{62,59,58,56,55,49,48,47,46,44}

* (NEW) ConTeXT support:
 - Beta/testing. Require &quot;--with-context&quot; while &quot;./configure&quot;ing
 - Filetype, hilight
 - Autocompletion [ \start...\stop, \begin...\end ]
 - Table wizard [ natural table only ]
   As I do*NOT* know conTeXT, your requests are highly appreciated!

* Autocompletion:
 - FIXED: BUGS#55
 - (NEW) Collector: new command/environment will be added
   automatically to the database [ ~/.winefish/words_s ]
   *WARNING* the file is bigger day by day :)
   FIXME: Winefish eats also '\\notacommand'
   TODO: add to Preferences Page [ A page for session words ]
 - If the result of completion contains *ONLY* one command:
  = The popup menu will be hidden automatically
    [ if the user's input equals to the result in popup menu ]
    It may be activated when you press CTRL + Space :)
  = You can hide the popdown menu by the (Page)Up/Down keys
 - Duplicate entries will be ignored when Winefish starts.
   TODO: do this *ONLY* once -- as the feature may slow down Winefish.
   An option may be added -- bigger Winefish :(
 - The autocompletion starts (automatically) *ONLY* if at least three
   characters are typed (includes the backslash: \xy).
   Anytime, press CTRL + Space!
 - The mininum width of popdown menu was enlarged [ 64 =&gt; 100 ]

* Outputbox:
 - Behavior changed: If a tool is set 'Show all output', the box will
   *NOT* scroll automatically. Why? 'Show all output' may produce to many
   lines and scrolling in this case will slow down the fish. 'cat' is a
   example. An option may be added in Winefish-1.3.2-7. Within the fix,
   'cat' is as fast as you want :)
 - For maximum space, the header of treeview was hidden.
 - 'Close' icon was placed on the upper left corner [ more beautiful :) ]
 - When main GUI is resized, the outputbox is resized too.
   FIXME: not correct if window state changes

* Autotext:
 - Autoindent supported. Winefish will append the 'indent' string
   to any '\n' characters of after/before string. I think this is GOOD,
   but it may make you tedious ;)

* Hilight Syntax:
 - Updated [ almost new syntax|color ]
 - Fresh color
 - Bugs fixed
 - (NEW) conTeXt hilight syntax [ testing ]

* LaTeX code:
 - Removed preformat items for: split, cases environment
 - Table: the '&amp;' character will be vetically aligned
   TODO: edit table's items within the wizard

* GUI:
 - Default mode is &quot;Experience&quot;. See below.
 - Sidebar, Main Toolbar, LaTeX Toolbar, Custom Menu are hidden by default
 - The values of 'View/*' will be stored as global session variable.
   This mean that they are (re)stored per session.
 - Last change of 'Document/Line numbers' will be stored as session variable.
 - Menu reordered: '/Edit/{Save Settings, Preferences}' =&gt; '/?/*'
   FIXME: cannot add '/?/tearoff1'
 - There are*NOT* any submenus in '/External/'

* The fish:
 - (NEW) splash screen [ Keep It Simple and Stupid ]
 - The fish is still blue. I need another one.
   [ So the fish does*NOT* live in the Splash ]

* Documentation:
 - (NEW) Added 'doc/TIPS'
 - The files 'doc/*.pdf' are removed from source directory --
   we may create a new package 'winefish-doc'.
   FIXME: The documation is 'out-of-date'.

* Translation:
 - vi: typo fixed [ Thanks to VnPenguin at <A HREF="http://vnoss.org/">http://vnoss.org/</A> ]
 - it: updated

* Stuff:
 - Disabled empty QuickBar warning.
   This may be considered as a TIPS -- addto documentation.
 - Code optmized: use (strncmp) instead of (strcmp) some places
 - (NEW) hilight: CHANGES, TODO, context
   I donot why these are needed. May be fun?
   At least I can read my CHANGES very very easily :)
 - Updated: THANKS, TODO, AUTHORS, README, and CHANGES :)
 - Added ROADMAP
