Subject: [Winefish-users] Some enhancement fo winefish
Message-ID: <1156247180.13989.18.camel@localhost>

Hi list, 
I'm writing my thesis with winefish and I'm enjoying it very much.
Hovewer I think it lacks something really simple to be the most beatyful
editor fo LaTeX :

1. Section and label handle.
Right now, it is possible to generate the structure of the document with
the Find window, using the regexp perl provided by kyhan in the doc
(thanks)

Would be really cool if an identation would be provided, according to
the importance of the section. 
example

Now:

section(foo)
subsection(foo_sub1)
subsection(foo_sub2)
subsubsection(foo_sub1)
subsubsection(foo_sub2)
subsection(foo_sub3)
subsection(foo_sub4)

what I'm thinking about:

section(foo)
|
+-subsection(foo_sub1)
|
+-subsection(foo_sub2)
	|
	+-subsubsection(foo_sub1)
	|
	+-subsubsection(foo_sub2)
+-subsection(foo_sub3)
|
+-subsection(foo_sub4)

with the ability of collapse the section

2. tab to support the label

When you write a large docume you need to refer to something already
written and a tab where all the label that you have already written are
provided should be really useful to find them out without searchin into
the whole document.

what do you think about ?

Michele

Hi Michele,

I am writing my master thesis too and I am so busy. This summer there is 
a few improvement that I could bring to winefish... You requests ( cold 
folding, label completion ) are all in my TODO list and I am sorry that 
we cannot have them this summer :( Currently you may use grep function 
for searching label though this function is not really comfortable...

I hope that I finish my thesis this November and only that time can I 
come back to the world of OSS. So sorry again ;)

Thank you for enjoying winefish.

Yours,

kyanh

PS:
there is a little story here 
http://metakyanh.sarovar.org/index.php?cat=soc2006 which tells about my 
this Summer of Code. But failing registering @ GOOGLE made me sick ;) 
and so I spent all my time on maintaining Vietnamese TeX Users Group and 
the thesis ;)

Don't worry... It's really simple to make a whishlist :)
The hard part is to transfom the whishes in features :)

Again.. just write your thesis... I also finish to write it in October..
Then I just have some times to collaborate :)
I'm not able to write in plain C, but if winefish would support plugin
from different language (I'm thinking about perl) I could try to make
some special tab. 
:)

Many thanks to you. winefish is simply the best editor for LaTeX.
That's it.

I know about this story, and I follow it. So it's right... This project
was not accepted by the google summer code because is NOT part of GNU
project?

What does it mean?

I know nothing about perl (except the name)... But I am thinking of 
implement a `script language` inside winefish. Using an already-language 
is the best choice, and it may be Perl. But I wonder what we can do with 
Winefish + Perl  ???

The most important features should be improved/implemented:
- hilight engine ( it is slow ; esp. if the file is very long)
- spell-checker with hilight support ( done in SVN version but quite slow)
- cold-folding (not yet)
- ...

I didn't know. Winefish is a little program and it's clear that SoC 
dislikes it ;) \let\winefish\relax!

Thank you for all,

Well...
This is a good question.

Maybe something that winefish lacks is a very handy way to write down
very complicated equation

this would be an idea :

The user just design the equation, and the engine should convert in
LaTeX. I don't know how to realize it right now. I'm just shot ideas.
It's more simpler to do this in Perl or in C ?

The gtk provides the 
GtkExpander http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.0/gtk/GtkExpander.html

We can think about it to display the list according to the level of
importance as set by LaTeX.

The structure of the document should be updated in an automatic way.
Or by button, an accelerator or whatever, but something really handy and
really fast to activate. As far as now there are more than 3 steps

1. <ctrl-f>  for the Find window
2. dealing with the combo to find the magical regexp 
3. click ok to put them in the Bookmarks 

It should be one button, or better none (I don't know how to discover..
I try to investigate.) :)


More over we need more tab.

We can't store everything in the Bookmarks. We have to separate label
from structure.

Again. It's more simpler to do this in Perl or in C ?

Of course the dependence of winefish would became bigger, and will cover
also the Perl stuff if the plugin should be accepted.
