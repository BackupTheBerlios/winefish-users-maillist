Subject: [Winefish-users] New page / lists for Winefish
Message-ID: <20111229223139.5a0bcbee@viettug.org>

Hi,

As Berlios will be closed soon, Winefish repository and homepage should
be moved to another place. Not very good, but at least it works. Please
use new home page, new lists, and please don't post on the old lists
(*@lists.berlios.de)

* Homepage: http://viettug.github.com/winefish
  (This is almost a default page generated by Github.)

* Users' list: winefish-users at googlegroups.com
  (see also http://groups.google.com/group/winefish-users)

* Dev.'s list: winefish-devel at googlegroups.com
  (see also http://groups.google.com/group/winefish-devel)

* Git repository (official): http://github.com/viettug/winefish

If you have any questions, feel free to let me know.

Thank you for supporting Winefish!

Best regards,
