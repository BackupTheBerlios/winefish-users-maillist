* drop HTML toolbar (above)
* remove some item from Edit Menu
(\textit,\texbf, some ams environments)

Hi,

I was a bit frustrated with the behavior of Kile and found WineFish. It
looks very nice and clean so far. I only miss (sometimes) a list of Latex
symbols (where the symbols appear) for those times when I have to include a
new symbol I don't use often. Other than that, it looks very nice!

Message-ID: <11e40dea0601100006o7a994b2p936b45eafbfa4f94@mail.gmail.com>

Another quick question: for some reason, winefish doesn't seem to be warning
me if I forget to close a math environment! I mean, something like opening a
formula with $... typing it ... there should be some way to not forget to
close the $ symbol!

Thanks,

I have some problem with this function ...
Seems like the Tex filters doesn't work anymore...

I have tried it out from console with the command:

aspell -t -c MY_FILE.tex
and it works in the right mode...

I miss something or it has to works out of the box ?

And if it would be possible to have an option to use several
dictionaries at the same moment. [I mean, I'm italian and write my
documents in italian and english ] 


> - menu items reordered (better???)

They're ok :)

> * dropped:

I find the toolbars really funny and useful...
It's possible to have it back ?
I know about your last email about comment out this idea..
But I was away from home and I discover this email only today.
sorry :(

I have several preambles according to what I'm going to write.. 
- Presentations
- Articles

with specific packages and macros..
If they can work as the  Insert/Tool/Code function would be really
useful.


And of course ..
thank you for this so cool software :)

I am sorry that I donot understanding what you mean.
Could you more specify? The TeX filter will ingore
all LaTeX command (started by the \backslash)
when checking. *NOTE* that TeX filter is a Winefish's
function, not a aspell's one.THIS MEANS THAT you must
run the spell checker from Winefish (menu Document/)
to enjoy the filter ;)

I am tedious with my templates too ;)
I will implement this feature after coding the brace finder.

The (c) is more stable than (d). Feel free to test it:

I'm sorry I've misunderstood.
I 've thoughts that you would use the aspell program in pipe or with the
api.

So I tried it inside winefish [From Document/Spell Checking ] and
outside [from the console]

Well just from inside winefish, I'll try to describe specifically my
problem:

with the italian language the filter works well :
-Recognise most of the LaTeX commands, although complain for the command
with the [] .. example:

\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}

Want to correct the [utf8] part.

With the en dictionary instead the filters doesn't work and doesn't
recognise all the LaTeX command.
I don't know why.
Any hint?

Ok just give it a chance right now (to the c version).

I'm a beta-tester ... 
I live on the edge :)

and winefish is to cool to be stuck with the stable version :)
