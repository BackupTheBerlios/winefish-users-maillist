&gt;<i> Hi Michele,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am writing my master thesis too and I am so busy. This summer there is 
</I>&gt;<i> a few improvement that I could bring to winefish... You requests ( cold 
</I>&gt;<i> folding, label completion ) are all in my TODO list and I am sorry that 
</I>&gt;<i> we cannot have them this summer :( Currently you may use grep function 
</I>&gt;<i> for searching label though this function is not really comfortable...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Don't worry... It's really simple to make a whishlist :)
The hard part is to transfom the whishes in features :)
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I hope that I finish my thesis this November and only that time can I 
</I>&gt;<i> come back to the world of OSS. So sorry again ;)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Again.. just write your thesis... I also finish to write it in October..
Then I just have some times to collaborate :)
I'm not able to write in plain C, but if winefish would support plugin
from different language (I'm thinking about perl) I could try to make
some special tab. 
:<i>)
</I>
&gt;<i> Thank you for enjoying winefish.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Many thanks to you. winefish is simply the best editor for LaTeX.
That's it. 

&gt;<i> Yours,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> kyanh
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> PS:
</I>&gt;<i> there is a little story here 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metakyanh.sarovar.org/index.php?cat=soc2006">http://metakyanh.sarovar.org/index.php?cat=soc2006</A> which tells about my 
</I>&gt;<i> this Summer of Code. But failing registering @ GOOGLE made me sick ;) 
</I>&gt;<i> and so I spent all my time on maintaining Vietnamese TeX Users Group and 
</I>&gt;<i> the thesis ;)
</I>
I know about this story, and I follow it. So it's right... This project
was not accepted by the google summer code because is NOT part of GNU
project?

What does it mean?


Michele
