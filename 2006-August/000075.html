Well...
This is a good question.

Maybe something that winefish lacks is a very handy way to write down
very complicated equation

this would be an idea :

The user just design the equation, and the engine should convert in
LaTeX. I don't know how to realize it right now. I'm just shot ideas.
It's more simpler to do this in Perl or in C ?


&gt;<i> The most important features should be improved/implemented:
</I>&gt;<i> - hilight engine ( it is slow ; esp. if the file is very long)
</I>&gt;<i> - spell-checker with hilight support ( done in SVN version but quite slow)
</I>&gt;<i> - cold-folding (not yet)
</I>The gtk provides the 
GtkExpander <A HREF="http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.0/gtk/GtkExpander.html">http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.0/gtk/GtkExpander.html</A>

We can think about it to display the list according to the level of
importance as set by LaTeX.

The structure of the document should be updated in an automatic way.
Or by button, an accelerator or whatever, but something really handy and
really fast to activate. As far as now there are more than 3 steps

1. &lt;ctrl-f&gt;  for the Find window
2. dealing with the combo to find the magical regexp 
3. click ok to put them in the Bookmarks 

It should be one button, or better none (I don't know how to discover..
I try to investigate.) :)


More over we need more tab.

We can't store everything in the Bookmarks. We have to separate label
from structure.

Again. It's more simpler to do this in Perl or in C ?

Of course the dependence of winefish would became bigger, and will cover
also the Perl stuff if the plugin should be accepted.

&gt;<i> - ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; PS:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; there is a little story here 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; <A HREF="http://metakyanh.sarovar.org/index.php?cat=soc2006">http://metakyanh.sarovar.org/index.php?cat=soc2006</A> which tells about my 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; this Summer of Code. But failing registering @ GOOGLE made me sick ;) 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; and so I spent all my time on maintaining Vietnamese TeX Users Group and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the thesis ;)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I know about this story, and I follow it. So it's right... This project
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; was not accepted by the google summer code because is NOT part of GNU
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; project?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What does it mean?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I didn't know. Winefish is a little program and it's clear that SoC 
</I>&gt;<i> dislikes it ;) \let\winefish\relax!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>wow.
\relax++
&gt;<i> Thank you for all,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,

</I>&gt;<i> kyanh

Thanks to you. :)
