Subject: [Winefish-users] Problem with auto-completion
Message-ID: <7b85fe720902050432gc057949j4aacd609067ea463@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I've used winefish before, one year ago, and I remember that while typing
you would have pop-ups proposing completion. Now I've compiled the latest
version (1.3.3) from the source on a Fedora Core 10 and this feature is not
working anymore. I got the same problem on another computer (running Debian)
with the winefish deb package installed.

The autocompletion is activated in the menu 'Document', also when you hit
'Refresh' in the preferences panel, on the 'Word List' section in 'AutoX'
tab you can see all the latex vocabulary, wich is also available in
~/.winefish/words (the file words_s is empty, I don't know if it should
be...). And if you use CTRL+SPACE then you have the differents completions
proposed. My problem is that these completions don't appear automatically
while typing in the document, you need to press CTRL+SPACE, and from what I
remember it used to appear automaticaly a year ago when I was using
Winefish.

Is that normal? if not does anyone know what could be the problem?

Thanks
Adrien
