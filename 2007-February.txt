Subject: [Winefish-users] Svn not update?
Message-ID: <1172321536.9492.6.camel@the-tux>

Hello,

I'm trying to build winefish from the svn, but It fails.

I suspect that the svn is not updated. 
If I build winefish from the tarball it works out of the box.

Also the version in the SVN (revision 99) is older VERSION=1.3.2-5

Can you update the with the last code from the package?
