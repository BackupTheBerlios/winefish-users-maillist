;) thank you very much Michele! i have updated via new system:
http://developer.berlios.de/forum/forum.php?forum_id=19330

help emacs fan happy but VI';) The development meets its end : now i can 
type for example: <control>S[ to selet from current position to the 
start of line ;) Many editor function will be added ;)

Feel free to comment and suggest though there's no any devel version now!

Thanks kyanh for Great TeX/LaTeX App! and also for distro respective
maintaners.
I'm using it every day for my report or just for fun..
The simplicity of winefish is the best advantage of it. It does not 
disturb or distract me when writing.
The only thing I want is that the icon of winefish.
It seems that the icon does not have alpha channel. It has just white 
background  so it does not match for other icons' look-and-feel.

Is there any plan for replcing this icon? 
yeah, this is just my wish-list.

i am not good at graphic designing . The current icons are just the 
workaround things ;) Could you help me creating some new ones? or give 
me some advices in using GIMP ?

I still have problem with the spell check feature .
I know that bluefish use a client for Aspell program.

why winefish can do the same?
Aspell is really robust, the TEX filter should work out of the box.
what do you think about ?

But your work is so valuable ;)

No matter ;) Let's see how we can change the accel. keys for winefish 
1.4.0.1

map: func_delete_line_end: <control>dl:
map: func_delete_line_start: <control>dr:
(there's a dozen of editor functions)

;) it's very very easy to change accel .keys now!

This requires that we have to work with aspell. bluefish has the html 
filter and I don't think that it works outside bluefish's GUI ;)

Anyway, I will think of it!

Hi Michele,

I replied in the user list but berlios server seems to be down these days.

Using aspell out of the winefish, you may enter the TeXmode like this:

$ aspell -t -c foobar.tex

( aspell will ignore all latex commands )

Please try `$man aspell` for more details

Cheers,

Yes, I know this feautere of aspell [if my brain is not fried I've
already written this command on this mailing list... or was another ??..
doesn't matter...]

What I was asking is:

Would be possibile to use aspell from inside winefish GUI, and do launch
aspell from the console ?

:)
