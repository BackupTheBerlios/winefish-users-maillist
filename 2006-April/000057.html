No problem.

&gt;<i> Could we make the package without the man page? this makes thing easier...
</I>
First: The unofficial package is already ready, so you can update the
information on winefish.berlios.de. And following my stats, the updated
package was already downloaded by many users.

Second: I need a manpage for the official Debian package (the policy
says: every executable should have a manpage). Because of the policy
statement I already wrote a winefish manpage a long time ago for my
winefish Debian packages. Now you provide one, so I don't need to
provide mine. I just need to know the copyright and license information.
Patching the files is not a problem. My Debian package already contains
the fixed manpage.

Regards, Daniel
