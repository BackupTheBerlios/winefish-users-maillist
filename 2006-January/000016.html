</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hi .. just tried out and tested :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
;) thank your for you try ;)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - TeX filter for spell checker
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have some problem with this function ...
</I>&gt;<i> Seems like the Tex filters doesn't work anymore...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have tried it out from console with the command:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> aspell -t -c MY_FILE.tex
</I>&gt;<i> and it works in the right mode...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I miss something or it has to works out of the box ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I am sorry that I donot understanding what you mean.
Could you more specify? The TeX filter will ingore
all LaTeX command (started by the \backslash)
when checking. *NOTE* that TeX filter is a Winefish's
function, not a aspell's one.THIS MEANS THAT you must
run the spell checker from Winefish (menu Document/)
to enjoy the filter ;)

&gt;<i> And if it would be possible to have an option
</I>&gt;<i> to use several dictionaries at the same moment.
</I>&gt;<i> [I mean, I'm italian and write my
</I>&gt;<i> documents in italian and english ] 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Currently i develope the 1.3.2 families which contains
the most important features is brace finder. You request
will be listed in TODO ;)

&gt;<i> &gt; * dropped:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - toolbars (i have never used it)
</I>&gt;<i> I find the toolbars really funny and useful...
</I>&gt;<i> It's possible to have it back ?
</I>&gt;<i> I know about your last email about comment out this idea..
</I>&gt;<i> But I was away from home and I discover this email only today.
</I>&gt;<i> sorry :(
</I>
Don't worry...I will support `--with-toolbars' options soon.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * stuffs:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - added Menu External/Soft Clean
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>
&gt;<i> Would be also useful to store somewhere some user preambles:
</I>&gt;<i> I have several preambles according to what I'm going to write.. 
</I>&gt;<i> - Presentations
</I>&gt;<i> - Articles
</I>&gt;<i> - Books..
</I>&gt;<i> with specific packages and macros..
</I>&gt;<i> If they can work as the  Insert/Tool/Code
</I>&gt;<i> function would be really useful.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I am tedious with my templates too ;)
I will implement this feature after coding the brace finder.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And of course ..
</I>&gt;<i> thank you for this so cool software :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Thank you very much for you trying and kind words.

Regards,

kyanh
