Maybe... Yesterday I saw some messages in Berlios's developer pages; the
messages are in German (google translate didn't help.) I don't think
people would help if they are trying in German only :P

I am moving some materials from Berlios server to my laptop. The bad
news (and the only one, I hope) is that I lost the database (or I
can't connect to it) for the very old forum. There isn't any very
important thing there, but I don't want to lost something from Winefish
friends. I asked Berlios administrator, but I haven't received any
answer yet.)

Our plan:

* Move materials away Berlios hosting (in progress)
* Archive two lists (-users and -devel)
* (Nov 6th - 15th) Send official announcements, close the lists,
  redirect the homepage to new location

We will have at least one month before Dec 31th.

Feel free to comments.
