HI list.
One question and some feature request.

First of all I have noticed that the outputbox is really faster. 
And I think this is okkey :)
Maybe when LaTeX exit with status zero the asterisk would be blue
[everything?s fine], instead when exit with status !0 would be red [some
problem here]

The question:
I didn't understood the functionality of the three columns. More over,
is it possible to hidden in some way ?

The feautures :
- A color box would be really good. I mean, in the left tabs a box with
all the 68 colour named that comes with the graphics package.
The user should select one of them and with <Ctrl><Alt><O> [the C is
used for the Cursive] could insert this colour in the document.

The box would contain a square and nearby the name of the Colour. Maybe
two colunms would be ok.
Let me explain in the ASCI art :)
 _            _
|_| Brown    |_| Yellow
 _            _
|_| Red      |_| Orange
 _            _
|_| Blu      |_| Apricot

...          ...

- A tabs with Symbols. I know it is possible to download from CTAN the
Symbols.pdf, but If you could have really accessible the Symbol that you
need from your preferred LaTeX IDE it wouldn't be good ?


Thanks for reading :)

oops. i will fix this [ winefish -1.3.2.8 ]

Do you mean the column of outputbox?

the first: line number
the second: the basename of the file
the third: the message

when some errors occur `latex' will be report like this:
 >> foobar.tex:12:undefined control sequence
then winefish will capture it like this:
 >> 12 foobar.tex undefined control sequence

if there is linenumber, single click will open the file at specific line
and control+click will create a clone file. See winefish.html for more 
details.

People asks me for this features so many times ;) I currently cannot 
support this because:
* i am too busy with my maths studies;
* winefish currently doesnot support plugins;
* some other features should be implement first ( command editor, code 
folding);
* etc;

so symbols.pdf is the best way ;)

thank you again for your report.

best regards,

Well done!!!

:)


What I'm talking about was the new feature
* new features:
	- column markers (at most 3 markers)
	- column mark (testing)

the column markers.

I don't understand what is the function, and I haven't found how to disable.

Hi.. Another question [ and a suggestion]

I think the numbers of the versions with winefish is release is a little
strange.

I mean You use a pattern like:

1.3.2.$N$L
$N = progressive number
$L = progressive letter

so, looking to the past

1.3.2.6a
1.3.2.6a
1.3.2.6a
1.3.2.6a
1.3.2.6a
1.3.2.6a

I mean You use a pattern like:

1.3.2.$N$L

so, looking to the past
::devel::
1.3.2.6a
1.3.2.6b
1.3.2.6c
1.3.2.6d
1.3.2.6e
1.3.2.6f

::devel::

1.3.2.7c

::release::
1.3.2_RC1
1.3.2_RC2

::devel::
1.3.2.8a

When you try to get the new version [because the ASCI oreder is used]
The _RC2 seems to be more old of the 1.3.2.7c [what is not]


Okkey so now.. what?

Maybe use something more standard .. just
::devel::
1.3.2.8b
1.3.2.8c

Then go to the beta release 
1.3.3_beta1
1.3.3_beta2
1.3.3_beta3

The Release Candidate :
1.3.3_rc1
1.3.3_rc2
1.3.3_rc3

And RELEASE!!

1.3.3

Then restart the development version 

1.3.3.1a
1.3.3.1b
....
The beta
1.3.4_beta1
....
The RC
1.3.4_rc1
...
...


And the release

1.3.4


Why do this?

For two reasons IMHO:

One : I think it would be more clear to new user, that don't know the
pattern release of the project

Two : The package manager do an ASCI comparison when has to upgrade a package.
In this way you get the right selection, with the actual pattern the selection is wrong [almost on my system]

You could skip the beta if you think the package is mature enough, and the 
selection remain consistent.

What do you think?

p.s.: Sorry for the other incomplete mail.

i am just an amateur. i have asked some people but they didn't give me 
useful ideas so i looked at releasing of some other programs, then took 
my own ways;) some people has complained about that.

Don't worry. Version numbers are only a convention.
And we have to play with the ASCII alphabet
My proposed is :
use number.number.numberletter for development [as now]
then number.number.number+1_rcX for the release candidate

then release a stable number.number.number+1 



> Little question: what is the next release ?

I think winefish is stable enough to be released like a stable release.
So I proposed to just rename the 1.3.2.8a into 1.3.3_rc1 .

We can test it for 7-10 days then, if no bug arise , release a stable
version with version 1.3.3.

Moreover winefish is really stable on my system, I use it really
extensive [like 6-7 hours per day] , and use all the features, wizard
for figure, table, shortcuts and more ...
No problem found.

I also notice that a bug that was present before [Try to edit
preferences directed from winefish caused crash], now is fixed :).

Hope this more clear.

Message-ID: <1143729882.9956.30.camel@localhost>

Hi list.. I've seen there was a _stable-release_ ;)

Cool.

Another idea about the way how the releases are named ...
Why don't use the same pattern of the gnome project ?

with the _odd_ number the development version ... ALL the development
version

1.3.3.x (note the third number "3" is an odd number)



with the _even_ number the stable version so 
1.3.4.x (note the third number "4" is an even number)


in this way I think would be more clear also for the user...
or maybe the second number would be useful to keep the things in the
right way...

just

1.4.x --> stable version
1.5.x --> development

Anyway...
just don't release a package more updated [like the stable 1.3.2] with a
minor version compared to the development version [1.3.2.x], plz 
Every package manager would go crazy!!!!
;)
IMHO.

P.s.: I've just write a news in footnotes about winefish...
I've taken the changelog directly from winefish release note on web ;)

i am so sorry about that.

The problem is that your gtk+ is too old. Though the INSTALL file told 
that winefish 1.3.2 requires gtk+ 2.4 , but the real games need gtk+ 2.6 
or higher. (( The function `gtk_cell_renderer_combo_new' is only found 
in this version of gtk+ or higher ))

So please upgrade you gtk+ library... There's no other ways if you wanna 
use winefish 1.3.2 :(

Sorry again and thank you very much for trying Winefish

i am firstly  sorry about that i didn't use your suggestion in previous 
discussions. But... please wait... the true thing that: after something 
likes 1.3.2.7, 1.3.2.8,... i like to release the stable version 1.3.2 
(1.3.2 > 1.3.2.x, really ?) (( We got the trouble because of some RC 
releases like 1.3.2-RC1,... ==> this will not be repeated anymore ))

Does this make life harder ?

I may use it. But i like your previous suggesstions! For the later one i 
really don't know how to make a new branch!!!

Below that i understood. Sorry for any mistake (==> so more explain, plz ;))
Note that I will start a new branch now

scheme 1:

1.3.2 (now)

1.4.0 (new branch <== thing i wanna do now)
  1.4.0.1 (devel)
  1.4.0.2  (devel)
  ...
  1.4.0 (release)
1.4.1 (minor bug fixed)
1.4.1 (minor bug fixed
...
1.5.0 ( new branch again)
...

is this okay?

ooop i am sorry that I don't understand your idea here ;)

((
in comparing to wf 1.3.2.8.a (latest published devel release) the wf 
1.3.2 contains fixex for some bugs
))

Okkey. First of all I think winefish is really a cool editor for LaTeX,
and a lot of friends are going to use it ;)

I also presented it on my LUG. ;)

Now, why I'm so boring about the release number .. try to explain.

I'm on gentoo, and I can install winefish from source with emerge.

Scenario :
Two version of winefish avaible:
1.3.2.8a --> installed
1.3.2 [stable the new one] --> not installed (newer)
the command :
emerge --update winefish
should pick the new version and install it. So where is the trouble ?
The trouble is that in ASCII comparison 1.3.2.8a is > respect 1.3.2, so
emerge thinks that I have the last avaible version installed, which is
*not* true ;)

Want try it ?

just

# mkdir check (in an empty folder would be more clear)
# cd check
# echo "foo" > 1.3.2.8a
# echo "foo" > 1.3.2

then try
#ls -l
and show which one come first
in my system I get

mattions at the-tux ~/Desktop/check $ ls -l
totale 8
-rw-r--r-- 1 mattions users 4 31 mar 14:52 1.3.2
-rw-r--r-- 1 mattions users 4 31 mar 14:52 1.3.2.8a

the 1.3.2 < 1.3.2.8a and is shown first.

That's why when you release a new version of the winefish you should use
a bigger third number, respect the devel version. In this cause should
had been 1.3.3.

Hope this more clear.

No...It's not ok ;)

Try to explain

One way would be:
scheme 1:

1.3.2 (now)

1.4.1.0 (new branch <== note the odd number -- development -- we start
 with 1, not with 0, because is a new branches and a lot of new features
 are in testing)   

  1.4.1.1  (devel)   
  1.4.1.2  (devel)   
  ...   
when times are mature 1.4.1.last_devel_version ==> 1.4.2.0

1.4.2.0 (release -- stable -- note the even number) 
  1.4.2.1 (minor bug fixed)
  1.4.2.2 (minor bug fixed
...

1.4.3.0 (devel)
  1.4.3.1 (devel)
...
when times are mature 1.4.3.last_deve_version ==> 1.4.4.0

1.4.4.0 (release)
  1.4.4.1 (minor bug fixed)

New branch

1.5.1.0

Why do this ?
If you have installed the 1.4.1.0 but a new release is available  its
number would be 1.4.2.0, then 1.4.2.0 > 1.4.1.0 => the right version
would be chosen.


scheme 2 (i think more clear):

1.3.2 [now]

1.4.0 (release the some code that is now named 1.3.2 as 1.4.0. In this
way we get a release version with an even number, and we have the
possibility to have minor bug fixes)
1.4.1 (minor bug fix)
1.4.2 (minor bug fix)
....


1.5.0 (devel) [first release for new branches, we would use only odd
number for development to be standard]
1.5.1 (devel)
1.5.2 (devel)
...
when testing is okkey and times are mature 1.5.last_development_version
==> 1.6.0 

1.6.0 (stable) 
1.6.1 (minor bug fix)
1.6.2 (minor bug fix)
...

1.7.0 (new branches for development)
1.7.1 (devel)
1.7.2 (devel)
....
when times are mature 1.7.last_development_version ==> 1.8.0

1.8.0 (stable)


If an user has the 1.5.x version installed and a new stable version
becomes available   (1.6.0) with an update command the right version
would be chosen.

Hope it's more clear. 

I think all the packages-managers [apt-get, yum, yast,
synaptics , .... ]   use the ASCII alphabet to compare which one is
greater, so which one is newer and has to be installed. 
Surely emerge think in this way.

I write about it on http://gnomedesktop.org/
Today I'm not able to connect to their site.
Until yesterday they didn't authorized my news.. but I hope that in few
days it would be authorized and displayed on their home-page.
